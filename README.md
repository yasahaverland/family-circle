# About the app and Goals
A private family app to share moments of your child’s development with the people in your house, the people that provide care for your child, and also people in your life that are far away.
The goal is for parents and caregivers to be able to upload pictures or take them directly from the app, and make photo collections with milestones. Also, I want this app to be a place where parents can easily find developmentally appropriate information, with a database of recipes according to age and nutritional facts. 
As a first-time parent in a country far from my family, I struggled with not finding the right information when I needed the most and with making my family feel included in my son’s life. I want this project to grow bigger so that parents like me can have a place they can rely on for any information regarding their kids. So that working parents can feel close and included in their kid's moments while they are in the care of others and loved ones can feel part of their lives even from afar.

#Tech Stack:
For this project, I want to focus on the front-end. Learn and implement technologies that will make the design, neutral, easy for the user, and appealing for all adults, while making it responsive to most devices. My goal is for this app to be easy to use, so it can be accessible to my target audience. The back-end still needs some more research for the database, ERDs are not my strong suit so I’ll look into working with a technology that makes this process easier to work with, so I achieve my goals.

##Front-end:
*JavaScrip
*React Js
*TailWind
*Figma

##Back-end:
*Python
*Django
*Django Augh
*MongoDB
